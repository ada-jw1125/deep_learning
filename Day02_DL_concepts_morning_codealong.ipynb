        "\n",
        "Training a network is an optimisation procedure, and therefore it relies on being able to quantify somehow the performance of models (networks in DL). To do so, we define a quantity that distills the performance of the model to a single number, called the objective function. In deep learning, we often use a measure of 'error' for this, and we try to minimise it, hence the name loss function. This quantity has other names, most of them summarised in the following definition from the Deep Learning book (Goodfellow et al, 2016):\n",
        "\n",
        ">*The function we want to minimize or maximize is called the objective function or criterion. When we are minimizing it, we may also call it the cost function, loss function, or error function.*\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "The two most common loss functions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mean squared error (MSE):  \n",
        "\n",
        "$$ L_{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i^N ( y_i - h_i(x) )^2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $h_i(x)$ is an element of the output of the network, $y_i$ and element of what we define as the target, and $N$ is the total number of elements for this data sample. For example, $h_i(x)$ and $y_i$ could be pixels in an image, and $N$ the total number of pixels in this image.\n",

For example, in the network we implemented on the first day, we had 10 classes (digits 0-9), and every time we ran a sample (image of a handwritten digit) through our network, we had an output vector with 10 values corresponding to the probability of the sample to belong to each class.\n",

        "<br>\n",
